\title{estimate hypothesis c_st}
\usage{
estCst(Xdst, Ydst, J, I, EM, em_maxiter, BALANCED)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xdst}{matrix of sums of number of eaten prey species s during occurrence t; rows indexed by time, and cols indexed by prey species, TxS}

\item{Ydst}{matrix sum of number of caught prey species s during occurrence t; rows indexed by time, and cols indexed by prey species, TxS}

\item{J}{vector of predators caught in each time period}

\item{I}{vector of number of days all traps were left out in a given time period}

\item{EM}{boolean; whether or not EM algorithm is used}

\item{em_maxiter}{integer specifying max number of EM iterations}

\item{BALANCED}{boolean; whether or not data are BALANCED}
}

estimates parameters from hypothesis lambda = c_st * gamma
}
